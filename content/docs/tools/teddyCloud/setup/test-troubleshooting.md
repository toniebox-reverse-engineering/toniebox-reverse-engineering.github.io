# teddyCloud - Test & Troubleshooting
## Connection toniebox to teddyCloud
First of all please be sure the cloud is not enabled in the webinterface. Then close all browser windows to teddyClouds webinterface and open the logs of teddyCloud. If you are using docker you can access them via: `docker logs teddycloud`.

To be sure your toniebox can connect to teddyCloud we do a so called "freshnessCheck". This can be initiated by pressing one ear of the box until the LED is pulsing blue.

### Error: Codeword turtle (Schildkr√∂te)
If the box is flashing red and shouts the codeword turtle, be sure teddyCloud is running and the box can connect to your cloud. Check the [DNS step](../dns).

### Error: Codeword owl (Eule)
If the box is flashing red and shouts the codeword owl, be sure teddyClouds `certs/server/ca.der` is identical to the one on box. Please check the [Flash replacement CA step](../flash-ca).

Sometimes you'll need to regenerate teddyClouds certificates as it may be defective. For that delete all files in `certs/server/ca.der` and restart teddyCloud. We had the case that an esp32 based box worked with the certificate, but the cc3200 based one had trouble. After regenerating the certificates it was fine.

This error can also happen if the box tries to reach the boxine cloud. Check the [DNS step](../dns).

Alternativly you may use a reverse proxy like nginx or traefik between teddyCloud and your box. This is not supported, teddyCloud needs its own dedicated IP address.

Example log output:
```
INFO |server.c:0574:server_init()| 1 open HTTPS connections
INFO |server.c:0574:server_init()| 0 open HTTPS connections
```

## Connection teddyCloud to boxine cloud
Please visit `http://<teddyCloud>/v1/time` and check the logs. You should see a number which is the current unixtime. The logs should look like that:
```
INFO |handler_cloud.c:0038:handleCloudTime()|  >> respond with current time
INFO |mqtt.c:0684:mqtt_init_box()| Skipping client 'Toniebox' (cn: 'default')
```
Please visit the webinterface and enable `Cloud enabled` and `Forward 'time`. Then visit `http://<teddyCloud>/v1/time` again and check the logs. You should see the time again and following log:
### Log is fine

```
Please check your client certificates from the [dump CA and client certificates step](../dump-certs).
### Error case - prod.de.tbs.toys is resolved to teddyCloud
```
INFO |cloud_request.c:0158:web_request| Connecting to HTTP server prod.de.tbs.toys:443...
INFO |cloud_request.c:0208:web_request|   trying IP: 192.168.xxx.xxx

```
Please check if `prod.de.tbs.toys` and `rtnl.bxcl.de` are resolved to your teddyCloud instance within its own container. Please either give your Toniebox a custom DNS that resolved them to teddyCloud or the teddyCloud instance a DNS that does not tamper the urls.

## Flashing back the previous image
If you somehow fail to setup everything but keep your previous image. For an esp32 this is the way to reflash back the image:

    python -m esptool -b 921600 write_flash 0x0 .\Downloads\tb.esp32.bin --flash_size 8MB

Resulting in the following example output
    
    esptool.py v4.8.1
