# teddyCloud

## Features
teddyCloud is an alternative server for your Toniebox, allowing you to host the cloud services locally.
This gives you the control about which data is sent to the original manufacturer's cloud and allows you
to host your own figurine audio files on e.g. your [NAS or any other server](setup/supported-server-hardware). It provides an easy to use WebGui.

You can also use teddyCloud on the command line to manipulate esp32 firmware dumps or encode Tonie Audio Files (TAFs). See ```teddycloud --help```.
