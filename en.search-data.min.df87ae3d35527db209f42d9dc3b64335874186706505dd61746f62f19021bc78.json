Both hex values represent the tag\u0026rsquo;s UID, but in reverse order.\nSo a tonie with the UID E00403500D0D3F47 has the audio content stored in the file \\CONTENT\\473F0D0D\\500304E0.\npredefined files # Upon initalization the box extracts the content of the flash-internal sfx.bin into two directories with several audio files:\n00000000\\000000* 00000001\\000000* Audio file format # In general the audio files are just OGG files with some custom header\nSo the files are structured like this:\n\u0026lt;file\u0026gt; ::= \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;audio_data\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; ::= \u0026lt;header_len\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header_data\u0026gt; where: \u0026lt;header_len\u0026gt; length of \u0026lt;header_data\u0026gt; in big endian uint32, usually 0x00000FFC \u0026lt;header_data\u0026gt; protobuf coded info fields like SHA1 hash, audio length, etc \u0026lt;audio_data\u0026gt; Ogg audio file Header format # The file header is coded using protobuf and contains these fields:\n1. [string] Audio data SHA-1 hash 2. [variant] Audio data length in bytes 3. [variant] Audio-ID of OGG audio file, which is the unix time stamp of file creation 4. [string] [array of variant] Ogg page numbers for Chapters 5. [string] fill bytes „00“ up to \u0026lt;header_len\u0026gt; To decode the protobuf content, you can use the online decoder at https://protogen.marcgravell.com/decode\nEncoding is a bit more tricky, as the tested encoder did not produce the correct data for the 4th field. Here the protobuf field type should be \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; and the content should be an array of multiple variants. One variant coded page number for every chapter in the file, starting with a zero for the first chapter.\nThe encoder produced either multiple variant fields with the same field number, or the correct string field except for files with only one chapter where it generated only a variant field. Long story short, the best choice was to build a custom protobuf encoder.\nAudio data # The container format for the audio data is Ogg, which packetizes the data into so called \u0026ldquo;pages\u0026rdquo;. Pages contain metadata like the time granule (timestamp) for playback, sequence number, checksum etc. and the real audio data in segments within the page. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg_page\nThe tonie files are encoded using an opus coder with around 96-116 kbps in VBR mode. (opus header say 96 kbps) The encoder was set up to produce Ogg pages that perfectly fit into a 4k (0x1000) byte sized page. As the box seems to read the data from SD into a 4k byte sized buffer, pages are only allowed to start at 4k-boundaries and must end at the end of the page. Pages can not cross the 4k boundary, else the file is treaten as invalid and gets re-downloaded.\nThere is no (to me known) way of \u0026ldquo;padding\u0026rdquo; data in a page so that the box would accept the data as valid. Thus the encoder must be configured in CBR mode with a certain bit rate, such that Ogg page header plus segments build up 4k sized blocks starting at 4k-offsets and ending at 4k-offsets. For sure there is a way to tell the opus coder \u0026ldquo;now please produce a segment with n bytes\u0026rdquo; which can be used to fill up the page until it\u0026rsquo;s 4k end.

This gives you the control about which data is sent to the original manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s cloud and allows you to host your own figurine audio files on e.g. your NAS or any other server.\nDocker hints # The docker container automatically generates the server certificates on first run. You can extract the certs/server/ca.der for your box after that.\nAn example docker-compose.yaml can be found within the docker subdir. Please beware that port 443 cannot be remapped and you cannot use a reverse proxy like nginx or traefik. The client certificate authentication needs to be done by teddyCloud. Also, there is no SNI. If you are using docker, you can use macvlan to give the teddyCloud container a dedicated IP address.\nPreparation # Please connect your Toniebox to your Wi-Fi and update its firmware. Many boxes are shipped with a production firmware that needs to be updated. Otherwise the box won\u0026rsquo;t work as it should.\nDevice specific preparation # Please check wether you got a Toniebox with a CC3200, CC3235 or ESP32 and continue with the following steps:\nDump CA and client certificates Flash the replacement CA DNS Test \u0026amp; Troubleshooting # If you have problems with teddyCloud or just want to be sure everything works as it should, please check our Test \u0026amp; Troubleshooting site.\nAdditional # Content # Please put your content into the /data/content/default/ in the same structure as on your toniebox. You can edit 500304E0.json file beside the content files to mark them as live or you can prevent the usage of the Boxine cloud for that tag with the nocloud parameter. By setting a source teddyCloud can stream any content that ffmpeg can decode (urls and files).\nWebinterface # Currently the teddyCloud webinterface is reachable through the IP of the docker container at port 80 or 443 (depending on your docker-compose.yaml). Changes affecting the toniebox (volume, LED) which are made through this interface will only be reflected onto the toniebox after pressing the big ear for a few seconds until a beep occurs.\nAs an additional frontend is still being developed, you can reach a second frontend at xxx.xxx.xxx/web.

Then close all browser windows to teddyClouds webinterface and open the logs of teddyCloud. If you are using docker you can access them via: docker logs teddyCloud.\nTo be sure your toniebox can connect to teddyCloud we do a so called \u0026ldquo;freshnessCheck\u0026rdquo;. This can be initiated by pressing one ear of the box until the LED is pulsing blue.\nError: Codeword turtle (Schildkröte) # If the box is flashing red and shouts the codeword turtle, be sure teddyCloud is running and the box can connect to your cloud. Check the DNS step.\nError: Codeword owl (Eule) # If the box is flashing red and shouts the codeword owl, be sure teddyClouds certs/server/ca.der is identical to the one on box. Please check the Flash replacement CA step.\nSometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll need to regenerate teddyClouds certificates as it may be defective. For that delete all files in certs/server/ca.der and restart teddyCloud. We had the case that an esp32 based box worked with the certificate, but the cc3200 based one had trouble. After regenerating the certificates it was fine.\nThis error can also happen if the box tries to reach the boxine cloud. Check the DNS step.\nAlternativly you may use a reverse proxy like nginx or traefik between teddyCloud and your box. This is not supported, teddyCloud needs its own dedicated IP address.\nExample log output:\nINFO |server.c:0574:server_init()| 1 open HTTPS connections INFO |server.c:0574:server_init()| 0 open HTTPS connections Connection teddyCloud to boxine cloud # Please visit http://\u0026lt;teddyCloud\u0026gt;/v1/time and check the logs.
